**********Problem**********
You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0

**********Solution**********
class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
        
        HashMap<Character, Integer> hm=new HashMap<>();
        char s[]=S.toCharArray();
        for(int i=0;i<S.length();i++)
        {
            if(hm.containsKey(s[i]))
            {
                int count=hm.get(s[i]);
                hm.put(s[i],count+1);
            }
            else
                hm.put(s[i],1);
        }
        
        int result=0;
        char j[]=J.toCharArray();
        for(int i=0;i<J.length();i++)
        {
            if(hm.containsKey(j[i]))
                result+=hm.get(j[i]);
    
        }
        return result;
        
    }
}
